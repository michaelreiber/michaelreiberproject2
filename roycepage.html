        <h3>Royce da 5'9</h3>
            
        <p>Whenever anyone mentions the name of Detroit rapper Royce da 5'9", a whole list of other names surround it. First, people mention his passing resemblance to LL Cool J. Others might know him as the guy who teamed up with teen singer Willa Ford on her 2001 hit "I Wanna Be Bad." He is also known as the rapper who got a major boost from legendary producer DJ Premier, who produced his 2000 hit "Boom." Mostly, though, people associate him with Eminem. Royce and Eminem have rolled together since their early days in Detroit and have worked together on several occasions. With the release of his 2002 album, Rock City, Royce da 5'9" made a name for himself.</p>
